                <h2>Integrated Agroforestry and Regenerative Agriculture</h2>
                <p>Sanjeevan is a collaborative initiative focused on transforming local ecosystems through Integrated Agroforestry and Regenerative Agriculture. Rooted in a systems-based approach, it combines the ecological benefits of agroforestry with the soil-restoring and climate-smart practices of regenerative agriculture. [cite_start]The aim is to build local climate-resilient, biodiverse, and productive landscapes that generate sustainable livelihoods, improve local nutrition, and strengthen market systems.

                <h2>What We Specialize In</h2>
                <p>We work in regions facing acute risks of agricultural collapse, livelihood loss, and nutritional insecurity. [cite_start]The core challenge is regenerating and productively using existing resources, moving away from extractive practices toward restorative, circular approaches. [cite: 3, 4]</p>

                <h2>Our Approach</h2>
                
                <h3>Reinforce conservation and productivity</h3>
                <p>Our integrated agroforestry model is anchored around local water sources. [cite_start]We build localized ecosystems that sustain themselves, enhancing water efficiency, improving yields, and contributing to better nutrition and income at the community level. [cite: 16, 17]</p>
                
                <h3>Access to marketplace</h3>
                <p>We build market systems by enabling knowledge, access, and connection through structured marketplace mechanisms. Our strategy includes product tracing, value addition, and aligning with market demand. [cite_start]These interventions also generate income by enabling access to carbon markets. [cite: 19, 20, 21, 22]</p>

                <h3>Enabling technology adoption</h3>
                [cite_start]<p>Solar power is a key enabler, providing reliable energy for water pumps, drip irrigation, soil moisture sensors, and more. [cite: 24]</p>

                <h2>How We Work</h2>
                [cite_start]<p>We work at the intersection of landscapes, livelihoods, and climate resilience, starting with diagnostics and growing into long-term partnerships. [cite: 27]</p>
                <ul>
                    [cite_start]<li><strong>Identify Transformative Ecosystems:</strong> We identify local agro-ecological zones where our approach can act as a lever for holistic transformation. [cite: 28]</li>
                    [cite_start]<li><strong>Spot Entry Points for Impact:</strong> We map opportunities with local actors for targeted interventions that can generate systemic change. [cite: 29]</li>
                    [cite_start]<li><strong>Diagnose Problems, Co-Design Solutions:</strong> We undertake structured assessments to understand local challenges and potentials, then co-design context-specific solutions with communities and partners. [cite: 30, 31]</li>
                    [cite_start]<li><strong>Build Collaborative Ecosystems:</strong> We convene multi-stakeholder ecosystems, engaging farmer networks, civil society, research institutions, and government bodies to align around shared objectives. [cite: 32]</li>
                    <li><strong>Facilitate Systemic and Outcome-Based Financing:</strong> We develop financing pathways by blending government schemes, donor grants, and private capital. [cite_start]We also explore outcome-based models. [cite: 33, 34]</li>
                    <li><strong>Activate and Scale Integrated Solutions:</strong> Our focus is on integrated deliveryâ€”from on-farm pilots to district-level scale. [cite_start]This includes technical training, capacity building, and value chain development. [cite: 35, 36]</li>
