                    <p>Sanjeevan is a collaborative initiative focused on transforming local ecosystems through Integrated Agroforestry and Regenerative Agriculture. Rooted in a systems-based approach, it combines the ecological benefits of agroforestry with the soil-restoring and climate-smart practices of regenerative agriculture. The aim is to build local climate-resilient, biodiverse, and productive landscapes that generate sustainable livelihoods, improve local nutrition, and strengthen market systems that drive lasting change.</p>

                            <p>Our integrated agroforestry model is anchored around local water sources, where agricultural practices and livelihood activities are designed to reinforce conservation and productivity. Rather than depleting resources, we are building localized ecosystems that sustain themselves that enhance water efficiency, improving yields, and contributing to better nutrition and income at the community level.</p>

                            <p>We are building market systems by enabling knowledge, access, and connection through structured marketplace mechanisms. Our market linkage strategy includes product tracing, value addition activities such as processing, and alignment with market demand through ongoing analysis. These interventions also generate income by enabling access to carbon markets.</p>

In many of the regions where we work, we harness the abundance of sunlight to sustainably meet these energy needs.</p>

                    <p class="section-description">We work at the intersection of landscapes, livelihoods, and climate resilience—starting with place-based diagnostics and growing into long-term, systemic partnerships.</p>
                    <ol class="work-list">
                        <li><strong>Identify Transformative Ecosystems:</strong> We begin by identifying local agro-ecological zones where integrated agroforestry and regenerative agriculture can act as levers for holistic transformation—improving productivity, resilience, and ecological health.</li>
                        <li><strong>Spot Entry Points for Impact:</strong> Working with local actors, we map opportunities where targeted interventions—in agriculture, water systems, nutrition, or income diversification—can generate systemic change.</li>
                        <li><strong>Diagnose Problems, Co-Design Solutions:</strong> We undertake structured assessments to understand local challenges and potentials. Using a combination of systems thinking, participatory tools, and technical expertise, we co-design context-specific solutions with communities and partners.</li>
                        <li><strong>Build Collaborative Ecosystems:</strong> We convene multi-stakeholder ecosystems, engaging farmer networks, civil society, research institutions, private sector actors, and government bodies to align around shared objectives and enable collaborative implementation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Facilitate Systemic and Outcome-Based Financing:</strong> We develop financing pathways by blending government schemes, donor grants, CSR, and private capital. Where feasible, we explore outcome-based models—tying financing to results across livelihoods, carbon, nutrition, or water security.</li>
                        <li><strong>Activate and Scale Integrated Solutions:</strong> Our focus is on integrated delivery—from on-farm pilots to district-level scale. This includes technical training, capacity building, value chain development, institutional strengthening, and monitoring systems that track real-world impact.</li>
